# client-trakker

C# project created by Jay Gervais.

This is a hobby project I am working on to explore the features of WPF and C#. 

The idea is that this will be a general-purpose application to assist with organizing projects. This application includes client details, reminders, and I am hoping to have it track tasks and create invoices, along with other features that may be beneficial to freelancers, business owners, or those working on their own projects.
